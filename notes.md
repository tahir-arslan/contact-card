Module 19
focus on optimizing performance of web applications 
PWA's (`progressive web apps`) blend benefits of traditional browser experience with mobile app to address performance issues
Use Chrone DevTools and Google Lighthouse to measure web app performance
DevTools allows you to monitor network traffic and inspect size of resources downloaded to browser
Lighthouse provides performance scoring system based on metrics like application bundle size, time to interaction, time to first meaningful paint, etc
`Client-Server Model` (helps to separate tasks performed by front end/client vs server)
`Webpack` tool to help bundle compressed assets that result from optimizations to deliver smaller app bundle sizes to client
`IndexedDB` a low-level API that allows large amounts of structured data to be stored in browser
`Workbox` offers caching and offline functionality by creating a `service worker`
use `Heroku` for deployment with `Heroku Staging`

PWA's offer many benefits and has access to native funtionalities but cannot use every functionality (only some) ex. cannot use Apple's Siri, Touch/Face ID, Bluetooth. Cannot be installed through popular application marketplaces ex App Store or Play Store.
